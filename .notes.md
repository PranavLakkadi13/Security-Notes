# protocol defined points

1. only owner can call the changefeeAddress

2) only users can enter raffle and refund value functions

# notes taken

1. solc version 0.7.6 --> check issues with the version (overflwo and underflow)
2.

# issues

IMP ---> should use safeMath to check for overflow and underflow issues

1. `getActivePlayerIndex()`
   --> should internally call the `_isActivePlayer()` and then see the return value and then return
   the bool along with index if just 0 is returned then it could be assumed as index[0] rather return (false,0) for address not active

2. `refund()`
   --> use of a mapping will be recommeded over array since a user will have to remember the index number
   --> use of call rather send
   --> make null address check before msg.sender check
   <!-- CEI was not followed -->
   <!-- Missed reentrancy, -->

3. `enterRaffle()`
   --> use of mapping to store players will be better than array
   --> if lot of players are stored at once it could cause a DOS attack on the network since to much gas is used
   --> missing owner check to see that owner should not enter
   --> missing check to see that feeAddress should not enter

4. `raffleDuration()`
   --> this variable can be marked immutable

5. `totalFees()`
   --> this variable should use uint256 rather than uint64

6. `players()`
   --> should use mapping over an array

7. `_baseURI()`
   --> checked no issues

8. `changeFeeAddress()`
   --> add a check for null address

9. `constructor()`
   --> check to see if the value entered are > 0 ,(raffleduration,rafflestarttime)

10. `selectWinner()`
    --> use chainlink/ any oracle to get random number this can be manipulated
    --> the winner can be manipulated
    --> the winning can also be manipulated
    --> Follow CEI
