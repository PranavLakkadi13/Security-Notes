# personal idea of the project

main goal --> only the user should set the password and only he should retreive it 
                others should not be able to see the password 


# notes

1. check the solidity version docs and see if any vulnerability is there in that version
2. the owner is the deployer of the contract and only he should set the password 


# attack vectors
----> setPassword - 1) check if the access control is there?
                    2) the password if passed as param it can be viewed by miners?
                    3) the storage is open so everyone can see?
